# Team_9_Club_Management_Portal
Club Management Portal for SA office @ IIIT Delhi


### Initial Prototype
 - Follow instructions from to get dependencies `Instructions.md`.
 - User Authetication has not been completed so for the time being any person can view and add events. 
 - The app starts from the home page where you can see the upcoming events followed by the clubs. The database is yet to be populated.
 - Clicking on an event redirects you to its page where you can see additional info.
 - The event page shows event information along with admin uses which is currently not functional.
 - Clicking on an club redirects you to its page where you can see additional info
 - Some links are yet to be made.
 - Once on a club page, you can view additional details, social media information, upcoming and previous events. Also, there is a button `Propose Events` to add new events. At this moment anyone can add new events and they get automcatically approved but the club will not get associated with that event because user authetication is what ties this all together.
 - The event form allows you to fill all necessary details and attach a poster/image.
